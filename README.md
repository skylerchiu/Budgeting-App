# Budgeting App

Link to final project: https://scbudgetingapp.herokuapp.com/

## What is this?
This is a budgeting app that was built with React and Node.JS that allows one to track their income and expenses and set financial goals. The web application tracks the current balance of the user, as well as a list of their transactions, and displays the values, as well as a progress bar to visualize their progress. The user can also categorize their transactions, and, with the use of Chart.js, the program will display a pie chart showing the distribution of the users budget towards different expenses, as well as their sources of income. A REStful API was built to handle the POST/GET/DELETE requests to and from the MongoDB database. This allows the users transactions to be saved and made available on any device. The app was deployed to Heroku, and is available through the link above.
